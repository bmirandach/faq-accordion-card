### Thoughts

When I first saw this challenge I thought 'ha! This is where the details tag comes in handy'.... haha.I spent a good amount of time trying to replace the marker with the icon provided here. So... I had seen some tabs on codepen made with input and went there looking for pens to guide me. The result was really pretty :)

Of course once you clicked a label the content won't hide until you select another input with the same name. To hide the input I used a class to make them disappear from the screen but not for screen readers (In the code below is called input).

I decided to use the picture tag for the illustration but changed my mind while coding, the things that made me change it for a div with a background image were:
- the lack of the image would not affect the content of the page
- I couldn't think of an alt text to write for that...

CSS classes... I read about how to properly name classes but when I had to do it... it's not so easy then, huh? I was trying to make reusable classes then decided against it. Why do I want a class with flex-direction: row and justify-content: space-between in this project if it will only be used for the elements of the accordion? There's already a class for that so why not add it? 'just do the thing for this project'

I wrote display: flex so many times! Still not confident with using it but I'm so happy it worked~

A piece of the accordion :

```html
<input type="radio" class="input" id="id-input">
  <label class="question" for="id-input">the clickable label~</label>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>The thing that will be hidden ðŸ‘€.</p>
  </div>
```
```css
.answer {
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.input:checked ~ .answer {
  height: auto;
}

.input {
  position: absolute;
  height: 1px; 
  width: 1px; 
  border: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE6, IE7 */
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
}
```

## Acknowledgments

Looking for a way to make an accordion without the details tag I found [Ali Majid's codepen](https://codepen.io/Ali-Majed/pen/JjWMRqv). I incorporated the rotate animation to my project because of that! ðŸŽ‰
